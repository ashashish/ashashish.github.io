They will not have access to other tabs, windows, applications, files, folders, or personal data on your device. You retain full control during the session and can end the co-browsing session at any time by clicking End Session. 4. Information Shared During Co-Browsing. During the session, the Representative will see information displayed in the shared browser window. However, personal information, such as passwords, account numbers, and routing numbers will be masked. During the co-browsing session, you agree not to provide, share or display any personal or sensitive information (e.g., passwords, account numbers, routing numbers). The Representative will not ask for such information during the co-browsing session. 5. Privacy and Data Protection.[Corpay] values your privacy and will use the information viewed during the co-browsing session solely for the purpose of assisting you with navigating our website.

You are responsible for ensuring that any sensitive or confidential information is not shared or displayed during the session. 7. Termination of Session. You or the Representative may terminate the co-browsing session at any time. [Corpay] reserves the right to terminate the session if inappropriate content is displayed or if the session is being used for purposes other than its intended use. 8. Governing Law.
